<h1>Thermal Screening Temperature Detection</h1>
<br>
<p>This repo is part our project The thermal Screening Drone and includes the source code of that is used to access and read the data from the a thermal camera installed in drone.The source code is written in python .It works with direct camera output and recorded media like video and images.I took some thermal images from internet to the check the functionality of code and respo also includes that output samples.</p>
